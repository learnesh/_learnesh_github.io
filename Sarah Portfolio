         <p> Hi, I'm Sarah. I'm originally from Ohio and moved to Chicago three years ago to pursue my dreams of a fulfilling career and harsh winter. I have degrees in Political Science and International Business from the University of Cincinnati where I graduated Magna Cum Laude and participated in numerous collegiate affiliations, including Delta Delta Delta Sorority and VP of the UC Law Club. After graduation, I went on to for Fifthe Third Bank as an Operations Analyst. While it was exciting to have a good job right out of college, I found myself unfulfilled and yearning to move to a big city and work with innovators and tech enthusiasts.
         <br><br>
         In April 2015, I had the opportunity to open the Chicago office for Yelp. Within two years I received four promotions and was in training to be a manager. While this looked fulfilling on paper there was still something missing and that was really having autonomy over my own career. By building the apps rather than selling them I found a new sense of purpose and innovative spirit I never thought possible. I have always been passionate about the industry, but now I'm even more driven to pursue a career as a developer.
